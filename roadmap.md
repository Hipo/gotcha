# ROADMAP

## Product

- Limits should be set for not paid users
- Payment options, user types and limits

## Backend

- Replace MongoDB with PostgreSQL, we may need complex aggregations in future
- Objects for using in urls and headers, instead of replacing each url or header one by one you should be able to replace
  the objects like access_tokens such.
- Show user reports, quota or current fetch count.
- Set response for urls, and able to check if the returning response is the same

## Frontend
  - Replacing lodash template engine with a proper JS framework
  - New design instead of using default bootstrap
  - New landing page
  - We need `about` and `how-to` page.
